I am a computer scientist with research interest in machine learning, computational linguistics and computational social sciences.  I worked on problems including language modeling and understanting, topic modeling and supervised/ unsupervised learning in the public and private sectors.

I completed my masters in Information Mangement at [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/) where I worked with [Jordan Boyd-Graber](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/).  I have a bachelor in engineering in Computer Science from Damascus University.

## Research Interests

My focus is in the applications of natural language processing and machine learning in computational social sciences. Particularly: finding representations that can help understand people's behavior from what they say and how they interact.

**Research Areas:**

- Language Representation, Knowedge representation
- News consumption and opinion formation
- Multi-task learning
