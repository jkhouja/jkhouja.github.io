I am a computer science practitioner working mostly on problems in natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML) and computational social sciences (CSS). I completed my masters in Information Management at University of Maryland, College Park where I worked with [Jordan Boyd-Graber](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/). I have a bachelor in engineering in Computer Science from Damascus University. More in my [resume]("/J_Khouja.pdf").


## Research

I worked mostly on problems in NLP; specifically language modeling, topic modeling and supervised/ unsupervised learning. I'm interested in the applications of natural language processing and machine learning in conversational modeling. Particularly: Computational methods that help model people’s behavior from what they say and how they interact.

**Research Areas:**

- Conversational modeling  (intent modeling, dialogue state tracking)
- Dialogue Systems
- Multi-task learning
